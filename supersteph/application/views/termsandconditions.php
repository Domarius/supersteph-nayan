<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An agreement has been made on the day of the dated Email between the addressee of the aforesaid Email, hereinafter called the BOOKER, and the company, SUPER PARTY HEROES, under which the BOOKER engages the company SUPER PARTY HEROES to provide a performer, hereinafter called the ARTISTE, and the ARTISTE accepts the engagement to perform on the date and time shown on the aforementioned Email, subject to the terms and conditions below.</p>
<p><strong>PAYMENT &amp; POSTPONEMENT:</strong></p>
<ol>

If payment is not received within 3 days SUPER PARTY HEROES will re-open the allotted time to other clients. Upon payment SUPER PARTY HEROES shall book the ARTISTE on the date and time agreed upon and not make any other reservations or accept any other clients for said date and time. For this reason, in the event that the BOOKER cancels the agreement for any reason, all monies paid shall be retained my SUPER PARTY HEROES in order to offset its loss of business within the guide as follows:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The amount agreed on the completed booking form will be deducted from the credit or debit card of the BOOKER<strong>.</strong> $110 of the deposit is non-refundable upon date of payment however, is transferable to another party, performed by the same ARTISTE.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If the contract is cancelled within 28-15 days of the performance date 50% of the contract fee will be payable and if cancelled within 14 days of the performance or less 100% of the contract fee will be payable.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>A guide for the number of children is quoted per show. If the number of children extends over that guideline the BOOKER understands that the show may not be as high a standard as usual (due to excess number of children). The SUPER PARTY HEROES reserves the right to adjust the show accordingly to best fit the numbers of children. This may mean omitting some of the activities of the show.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Shows can be postponed due to extreme weather such as cyclones, extreme warning storms, flooding where it will be unsafe to drive. However, this is at the discretion of the SUPER PARTY HEROES. Postponement terms are as follows:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Stephanie Lee-Harper (SuperSteph) can be postponed to a time between Monday – Thurdays at anytime, or after 3pm Monday – Thursday during school holiday periods, providing that she is available.</li>
<li>The team of other ARTISTES who work as sub-contractors for SUPER PARTY HEROES can be postponed to any day required, on the time slots of 12.30pm and 4.30pm on weekends, on the agreement that the same ARTISTE(S) that have been postponed, will fulfil the contract for the requested postponed day and time.</li>
